# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

I have worked with a few teammates on the Okta setup. We are learning how the code that was already here for us works.

2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?

I was a driver when configuring our backend deployment to heroku. I was a navigator when we needed an admin role from our TL so heroku could connecto to the github repo. I prefer the driver as I feel i can code at my own pace.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?

Not having control over what gets coded.

4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

I will try and learn to be more open to being a navigator when people need help with coding.
