## Questions

1. What's an example of feedback you were scared to give?

I wouldn't say i've ever been scared to give feedback. I feel confident in how I phrase and delivery feedback which keeps things calm and productive in a safe manner.

2. What were some common pieces of positive feedback you found yourself giving to team members?
   - Why do you think they were common?

Great job, good work, backend endpoints look good. I think they were common because we were working on the backend and basic feedback on the work we did.

3. What were some common pieces of growth feedback you found yourself giving to team members?
   - Why do you think they were common?

I'm honestly not sure. I guess maybe that we needed to keep it moving and keep producing.

4. Are there any examples of feedback you would word differently if given another chance?
   - Why would you change your wording?

Not really any that come to my mind, I try and do my best on picking my words carefully.

5. Do you feel like your feedback could have been clearer? How can you improve in the future?

Oh i'm sure, if i'm rushed and not clear in my mind I can say stuff that 100% could have been said better. I would probably just take more time to formulate a thought, then deliver it.
