## Questions

1. What piece of feedback have you appreciated the most?

Being more detailed. I feel like i've heard this before, but it seems like I always have to keep myself in check in order to stay on top of it.

2. What piece of feedback do you feel resistant to?

Usually when I'm told to do something, that I might find unproductive yet its a good thing, i don't like those at all.

    - Why do you think you're resisting it?

    Its hard to do something that you can't see the result immediately. And if i don't understand it, I don't like doing it if it can't see a valid reason behind it.

    - What do you consider valid about it and what strikes you as inaccurate?

    I usually trust whatever TL is telling me to do it, more than likely has a good reason and has been around the block longer than I have, so in general i trust their judgement.

3. What's an example of feedback that doesn't surprise you?

When i'm told to be more detailed. I feel like i'm always told that, even when I think i am being detailed and aren't. Gotta keep at that one.

4. What's an example of feedback that surprised you?

When someone says i'm a good developer, cause I feel like i suck most of the time.
