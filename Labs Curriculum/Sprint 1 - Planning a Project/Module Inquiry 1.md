# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

We as a group put together a few questions regarding the flow of the app. I was mainly concerned with the functionality of things, ie how we were going to structure the db. For the most part, it makes sense.

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

We created a product roadmap from a variety of user stories - How the data is handled if the user signed in is a leader of a topic or a user assigned to a topic. When a user creates a new topic, when should the join code appear. How the frequency setting will be setup once the user creates a new topic. Much more.

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?

My favorite user story is in regards to the unique join code and how its handled. We are going to set things up to have the join code associated to the id of the topic, so the data will stick togther.

    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?

    We did well at identifying what needed to happen. What was/is challenging is the shape of the data, this will require some more planning to accomplish.

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

I would approach a new product map in a similar way as far as the planning goes. I like how we put things into the user perspective, it helps eliminate the outliers and drill down to the specifics of what the user is going to step through in the app. I would allow more time to plan before moving onto the individual tasks, I think as you develop new tasks arise that weren't seen before so thats important to keep in mind.
