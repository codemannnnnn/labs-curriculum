## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today?

Some technical choices that I made today were to learn docker + postgres combo. Excited for it.

2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?

   - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
   - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.

   1. Docker. I have used in the past to run containerized versions of binaries and it worked great.
   2. Postgres for our DB. Although I have much to learn with it, we as a team agreed Postgres would be our best route.

3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.

The reasoning behind why we chose docker was much because of how efficient Docker is, and postgres was a team decision due to its robust mechanism.

4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process:
   - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?
     A good technical decisions must be weighed in every aspect, I believe it is very important to think outside of the box when it comes to working through the tech planning phase to ensure everything makes sense before moving forward.
